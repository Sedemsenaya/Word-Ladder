My Name is Collins Sedem Senaya
I am certainly sure that all the code that I have included in this ReadMe file is mine and I take credibility for it.
I have not provided any of the code that I have written to anybody.
I have only asked my colleagues if they were making any progress anytime we meet in class.
The only difference that I have is that I was not able to print out the exact words for the pair (fate, kate) which,
according to the prompt should be just fate and kate, but I got fate, tate and kate and I think tate is also a valid
successor for fate.
Thank you.
